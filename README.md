## Project "Ardent"

The Ardent app provides an attention marketplace for project and communities to collaborate with its members and fans via incentivized tasks.

### Architecture Stack

This app is based on Ionic framework, providing a progressive and responsive desktop and native mobile experience. Much of the features such as search, relevance, and social graph will be off-chain via cloud API. The attention market transaction is handled by the Pendulum Protocol via Truffle's web3 library.

### Setup
